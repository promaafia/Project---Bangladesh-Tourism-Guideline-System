                <p><b>Comilla Victoria Government College (কুমিল্লা ভিক্টোরিয়া সরকারি কলেজ)</b> is a college in Comilla, Bangladesh. It is one of the oldest and renowned colleges in Comilla as well as in Chittagong division. The college is located on 29 acres of land including its intermediate and honors section. Landlord of that time, Roy Bahadur Anandra Chandra Roy, established the college on 24 September 1899. Anandra Chandra Roy was a renowned patron of promoting and developing education in the district. He was a contractor by profession and accordingly set aside a large amount of money to establish a college for the development of higher education in Comilla.
<br><br>
Comilla Victoria College was thus born to fulfill his long cherished dream. In recognition of his noble endeavor, the British Government awarded him the title “Roy Bahadur” after the establishment of the college. A white sculpture was built in front of the main gate of intermediate section of the college to keep the memory of Roy Bahadur alive. Queen Victoria was the empress of India from 1876 to 1901. At that time, Comilla was under the rule of the empire, hence the college was named as Comilla Victoria College.
<br><br>
Sattendranath Boshu was the first principal of the college. He was the headmaster of former Comilla Victoria School. He remained the principal of the college until his death. He was a scholar as well as a researcher of literature. He was also a professor of English and was awarded Rabindranath Prize for his outstanding contribution to literature. Prof. Fazlul Karim was the first Muslim teacher of this college in 1937. He later became the Vice Principal of the college in 1958 until his retirement in 1972 when the college was made a government college.
<br><br>
The college always stands first in Comilla Board on the basis of good result in HSC. Meritorious students try to get admission in this college because of its name and fame. Students of the Honors’ section also do very well in examinations. Most of the time students of this college get top positions in exams held under the national university.
